# Program 2 Reactive Agents

## Prompt

You have been given starter code for the segregation model. Notice that the output plots are stored in a png file (which you have to click on to see).

### A

Explore the Schelling model. Add output to indicate the percentage of each agent type
that meets the desired similarity_threshold.

### B

Add a feature where the similarity_threshold can be different for each of the colors.

### C

Add a feature to stop when little progress is being made. Print out a message to indicate how many iterations you did.

### D

Add a feature where agents can improve on their current location by performing a location swap with another agent who is willing to swap (in addition to just swapping with an open position).

### E

Add a feature where you prefer to move to locations in the neighborhood. The idea is that a move may be cheaper if the agent didnâ€™t move as far. Define neighborhood however you like.

### F

Explore something else you consider interesting.
For this I chose to add preferences for the proportion of neighbors with the same color.
