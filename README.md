## Schelling Model About

The Schelling Segregation Model, proposed by economist and Nobel laureate Thomas Schelling, is a computational agent-based model designed to explore how individual preferences for similarity can lead to the emergence of segregated patterns in a population. In this model, agents, representing individuals, are placed on a grid, and each agent has a threshold for the proportion of neighbors they find acceptable. If the proportion of neighbors that match their preference falls below this threshold, the agent seeks to move to a new location. Through iterations of agent movements, the model demonstrates that even slight individual preferences for similarity can result in the formation of homogeneous clusters, illustrating how macro-level segregation can emerge from micro-level interactions without the necessity of explicit discriminatory behaviors.
